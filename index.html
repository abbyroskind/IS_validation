        <p>Are you interested in meeting new people in your community through fun experiences or shared interests?</p>
        <p>Is it sometimes overwhelming and exahusting coordinating your social life or a fun outing?</p>
        <p>Are you interested in just having someone to do something with?</p>
        <br>
        <p>Abby is working on a project that will connect strangers in close to real-time (or farther in advancae, if that's your jam) to do fun things together. Think meeting up for drinks or dinner, going to a museum, going to see show together, etc.</p>
